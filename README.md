# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

This Project is built on a React frontend and a Python Flask backend with Stripe payment integration.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   - Get MongoDB URI (local or MongoDB Atlas)
   - Get Stripe keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com
   - Get Resend API key from https://resend.com
   - Set your sender email

4. Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install Node dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Environment Variables Required
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key (starts with sk_)
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Stripe publishable key (starts with pk_)
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Resend email service API key
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Email address for sending confirmations

## Digital Photo Marketplace Features
- Browse available photos
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Email confirmation after purchase
- Order tracking in MongoDB
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
